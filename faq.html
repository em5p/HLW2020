        <div> <span >What is Periodt?</span> </div>
        <p>
            Have you ever run out of menstrual products while out in public? Periodt is an application that allows womxn to connect with friends/others nearby to request or donate menstrual products.It allows womxn to use the maps on their phones to get directions to other womxn and get sanitary products from them or receive help.
        </p>
        <div> <span >How can I maintain personal safety while using the application?</span> </div>
        <p>
            Periodt encourages its users to meet up in public spaces such as coffee shops, grocery stores, parks, and restaurants. We ensure that your location is not being shared with others when you do not want it to.
        </p>
        <div> <span >How do I find other womxn on this app?</span> </div>
        <p>
            Once you submit a request for menstrual products on the app, the app searches for other womxn within walking distance to you. If other womxn in the area are found, they can agree to meet up with you at a specified public location.
        </p>
        <div> <span >How do I meet up with others on this app?</span> </div>
        <p>
            This application uses a map API to ensure that you can find your way to other people. In order to do this, you can contact others through the chat functionality and get directions to them through the map.

                <h2>Why We Created This</h2>
                <p>
                    If you menstruate, you probably have been in a situation where you started your period but did not bring a pad or a tampon with you. If you do not feel comfortable directly approaching someone to ask if they had spare products, this app was created for you! We created this app because we believe that having acess to menstrual products is crucial for maintaing good hygiene and comfort. Lacking of products shouldn't impede with daily life and it's an easy way to help and support each other
